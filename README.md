# SQL-Stored-Procedures-and-Functions
A simple SQL Task demonstrating the use of Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL. The project is based on a Library Management System, where a stored procedure lists books by author and a function calculates overdue fines. This task focuses on reusable SQL blocks, parameter usage, and conditional logic to modularize SQL operations.
